## 🚀 **3 Ways to View Your Website**

### 1. 📱 **View It RIGHT NOW Locally**

The easiest way to see your website immediately:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /home/runner/work/homesearch/homesearch

# Start a local web server
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

**That's it!** You'll see exactly what's in the screenshot above. ✨

### 3. 💻 **Open HTML File Directly**

The simplest (but not recommended) way:

1. Navigate to: `/home/runner/work/homesearch/homesearch`
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. It will open in your default browser

**Note:** Some features might not work perfectly with this method. Using a local server (Method 1) or GitHub Pages (Method 2) is much better.

Try these alternatives:
```bash
# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js (if installed)
npx http-server -p 8000

# PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```
